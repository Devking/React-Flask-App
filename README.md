Flask + React app that doesn't use `create-react-app` and doesn't run a Node server alongside a Flask server. We write the Flask stuff as we normally would, and point to a JS file that we've used Webpack and Babel to prepare. Babel deals with the JSX that we're writing, and Webpack deals with the bundling and dependencies. There's no sophisticated communication between Flask and the JS stuff, but `create-react-app` doesn't have that either. This is essentially a recreation of `create-react-app` but with Flask instead of Node.

Following [some of this](https://medium.com/@chrislewisdev/react-without-npm-babel-or-webpack-1e9a6049714).

To compile the src js to usable js:

```
cd static
npm run build
```

This will use Webpack and Babel to turn the code you wrote into something that can be understood.

To run the Flask server:

```
flask run
```
